## Elevator pitch
_A SHORT (2-3 SENTENCES) PARAGRAPH THAT `DESCRIBES KEY INSIGHTS` TAKEN FROM METRICS IN THE PROJECT RESULTS THINK TOP OR MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS._ (Note: this is not a summary of the project, but a summary of the results.)

_A Client has requested this analysis and this is your one shot of what you would say to your boss in a 2 min elevator ride before he takes your report and hands it to the client._

## QUESTION|TASK 1

__Shorten the column names and clean them up for easier use with pandas.__ Provide a table or list that exemplifies how you fixed the names. 

Here I'm showing the first row of the data instead of the columns. The columns just listed as "Response" have their full context in the original columns names. For those, I simply shortened them so I would have an easier time working with them. They were long.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv(url, encoding="ISO-8859-1")

new_titles = ["id","has_seen_sw","is_sw_fan",
    "seen_1", "seen_2", "seen_3", "seen_4", "seen_5", "seen_6",
    "rank_1", "rank_2", "rank_3", "rank_4", "rank_5", "rank_6",
    "han","luke","leia","anakin","obi","palp","vader","lando","boba",
    "c3","r2","jar","padme","yoda","shot_first","familiar_eu","fan_of_eu",
    "trekkie","gender","age","house_income","education","location"]

temp_columns = df[1:].reset_index(drop=True)
temp_columns.columns = df.iloc[0]
fixed_names = pd.DataFrame({"First Row Columns":df.iloc[0].values, "New Column Names": new_titles})
print(fixed_names)

for col_num in range(len(df.columns)):
  df = df.rename(columns={df.columns[col_num]: new_titles[col_num]})

# Remove the first row
df = df.iloc[1:].reset_index(drop=True)

```

## QUESTION|TASK 2

__Clean and format the data so that it can be used in a machine learning model.__ As you format the data, you should complete each item listed below. In your final report provide example(s) of the reformatted data with a short description of the changes made.  
    a. Filter the dataset to respondents that have seen at least one film  
    a. Create a new column that converts the age ranges to a single number. Drop the age range categorical column  
    a. Create a new column that converts the education groupings to a single number. Drop the school categorical column  
    a. Create a new column that converts the income ranges to a single number. Drop the income range categorical column  
    a. Create your target (also known as “y” or “label”) column based on the new income range column
    a. One-hot encode all remaining categorical columns   

_type your results and analysis here_

```{python}
seen = df[df["has_seen_sw"] == "Yes"]
seen["age"] = seen["age"].str.split("-").str[1]
eds = {"high school degree": "1",
       "some college or associate degree": "2",
       "bachelor degree": "3",
       "nan": "0",
       "graduate degree": "4"}
seen["education"] = seen["education"].str.lower().map(eds).fillna("0").astype(int)
seen["house_income"] = seen["house_income"].str.replace(r"[\$,+]","", regex=True).str.split(" ").str[0]
seen["house_income"] = seen["house_income"].fillna(-1).astype(int)
seen["location"] = seen["location"].fillna("unknown")
seen = pd.get_dummies(seen, columns = ["location", "rank_1", "rank_2","rank_3"])
for i in range(1,7):
  seen["seen_" + str(i)] = seen["seen_" + str(i)].notna()
